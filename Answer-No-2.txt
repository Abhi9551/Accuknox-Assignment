Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. This means the signal handler is executed in the same thread that triggered the signal.

Code to Demonstrate Same Thread Behavior
We'll write a simple example to prove that Django signals run in the same thread. We'll use Python's threading module to print the thread ID of both the caller (the function that triggers the signal) and the signal receiver.

1. Signal Setup
In signals.py, we'll connect to Django's post_save signal and log the thread IDs of both the caller and the signal handler.

# signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import threading

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_post_save_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal handler is running in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

2. Trigger the Signal
We will trigger the post_save signal by saving a User instance and log the thread ID of the calling thread.

# views.py (or you can run this in the Django shell)
import threading
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Log the current thread in the caller
print(f"Signal caller is running in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Create a new user, triggering the post_save signal
User.objects.create(username='testuser', password='password')

Output:
Signal caller is running in thread: MainThread
Signal handler is running in thread: MainThread
